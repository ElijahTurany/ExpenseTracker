We are building an expense tracker for users to track their personal finances and monitor spending. The basis of this application is transactions with categories linked to accounts. Spending and income data can be filtered and visualized by account and category, among other criteria. 

All expense data is stored in a local SQL database. The application itself, created using Python, queries and updates this database based on the user's actions. The GUI front-end of the application is being developed using the Kivy library. Python and Kivy allow for a very flexible GUI.

This application is being developed for a UW-Stout Honors Project. We hope to publish this application upon completion.
